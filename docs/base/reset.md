# Reset
Archetype's main reset is powered by Archetype-Utilities, which uses a Sass version of Normalize that breaks up Normalize into modules so that anything unneeded can be easily disabled. 

## Normalize
{{ d['../sass/base/_reset.scss|idio']['normalize-mixin'] }}

## Additional Resets
{{ d['../sass/base/_reset.scss|idio']['additional-resets'] }}
