# Settings

The <code>_settings.scss</code> partial contains both [Compass](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass) and [Archetype](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype) settings that are applied project wide. Items such as vertical-rhythm and legacy browser support as well as Archetype's implementation of [Normalize](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype-Utilities/blob/master/archetype/_normalize.scss) are all controlled here.

{{ d['../sass/base/_settings.scss|idio']['settings'] }}
