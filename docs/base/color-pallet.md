# Color Pallet

The Archetype ```_color-pallet.scss``` partial is the first Sass file imported within ```settings.scss``` and controls all of Archetype's color settings. This is also where [Colorkit](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Colorkit) is imported to ensure that all color functions and variables are available globally.

When prototyping a project, it is helpful to keep your edits to ```_color-pallet.scss``` on a seperate git commit (or even on a seperate branch) to make it easy to jump back and forth between design iterations.
