# Base

Archetype treats everything within the design system as a component. Global settings used to alter multiple component's structure or skin are abstracted. These abstracted component settings are called base styles. Base styles are convenient for maintaining consistency within a design system. For example, by abstracting border-radius styles or interface colors it becomes much easier to make quick changes globally, as well as ensure that these values are consistently applied.
