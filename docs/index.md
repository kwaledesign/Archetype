<div class="partition partition--small partition--primary">
<p class="lead"><strong>Archetype:</strong> (noun) 1. A symbol, pattern, or prototype upon which others are copied, patterned, or emulated; 2. A flexible and modular Object-Oriented Sass architecture that supports multiple skins.</p>
</div>

Archetype is a front-end toolkit designed with the principles of [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss) and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com) for building responsive, mobile-first sites and applications using a specific [coding standardard](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Coding-Standards). Design decisions are kept as minimal as possible to avoid extensive overrides while still providing basic structure and skin styles for each component to allow for quick prototyping in the browser.

## Dependencies
Archetype is built with Sass on top of Compass using [Colorkit](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Colorkit), [Archetype-Utilities](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype-Utilities), [Breakpoint](https://github.com/Team-Sass/breakpoint), and [Modular-Scale](https://github.com/Team-Sass/modular-scale). 

Archetype's SMACSS-like modularity separates layout styles from components so that you may include your own layout styles or easily incorporate any grid framework like [Singularity](https://github.com/Team-Sass/Singularity) or [Susy](https://github.com/ericam/susy).

## Installation
Archetype can easily be installed via [Git](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype#installation), via [Compass Extension](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype-Compass), or via [Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/kwaledesign/generator-archetype) (still in development). There is also a Drupal base theme built on Archetype called [Archetype-Drupal](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype-Drupal).

## Additional Information
You can view the [source on GitHub](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Archetype), read the [Coding Standards](https://github.com/kwaledesign/Coding-Standards) on which it's built, or checkout the [Archetype Documentation](http://kwaledesign.github.io/Archetype).
