# Spacers

Spacers are standardized units of measure for use on any CSS length property. They can be used on margins and paddings.  By default, the ```$base-unit-spacer``` is set equal to the ```$base-line-height```. Fractional spacer units are derived off the ```$base-unit-spacer```. All of these variabels can be adjusted within the ```_settings.scss``` partial.
