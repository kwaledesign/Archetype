# Archetype Changelog

## Sat Aug 24, 2012
  * Merged docs into core Archetype
  * Removed bower-integration.md because no longer necessary due to recent Bower update that renames `components` to `bower_components` as default.
  * Updated docs-update.sh bash script to new file paths. Also added a `git status` command.
  * Cleaned up README.md with new install instructions
  * Add Archetype-Utilities as a dependency now that it has been converted to a compass extension.
