# Archetype Changelog

Because Archetype is currently under such significant development, changes will not be documented here until Archetype is out of Beta.

Archetype will remain in Beta until all of the following conditions are met:
  1. Semantic versioning is implemented 
  2. Git tags are implemented that correspond to the version numbers
  3. Git branches are implemented that correspond to the version numbers
  4. Archetype core reaches stability

Once out of Beta, changes to Archetype will be clearly documented here and the plugin will be published on the rubygems. Until then, please consult the repo's commit history.
